This project consists of a board game environment that satisfies the following requirements  
Requirements:  
The Board Game Environment should accommodate any board game that involves a grid layout and game elements on this layout, including games such as Chess, Checkers, Tic-Tac-Toe, Gomoku, Connect Four, Nine Men's Morris, Chutes and Ladders, Stratego, Shogi, Pente, Battleshipâ€¦  
The Board Game Environment should make it as easy as possible to create implementations of new games.  
The Board Game Environment should provide a defined interface that all game plug-ins must follow.  
The Board Game Environment should support two players, but can just run on one machine (no networking programming required)   
The Board Game Environment should support personal player profiles (the specifics of which are up to you). Login can be very simple, and does not have to be secure.  
The Board Game Environment need only support 2-player games (but you can support more players if you want to).  
The Board Game Environment should work by providing a player with a list of games they can play and allow them to choose which one to start.  
The Board Game Environment games should be GUI-based.  
The Board Game Environment should be written in Java.  
The Board Game Environment only needs to support running one game at a time.
